# Programming Fundamentals Final Project - Pacman
## Programming Language Applied: C++

The game includes 3 progressively challenging levels, each maze with a different color theme, divided into 4 Modules:

  1. Graphics, Level Designs and their Difficulty Progression (Muskan - Team Lead)
  2. User Input, Player Movement and Collision Detection (Eman - https://github.com/emann1318)
  3. Ghost Movements, and their Random and Chase Behavior (Anaya - https://github.com/anayaaaa0)
  4. Game States, Game Over, and Scoreboard Screen (Danyah - https://github.com/danyah03)

All things considered, our main objective is to deliver a thrilling and interactive Pacman experience to the players.
Hope whoever witnesses this project enjoys playing it, just as much as we enjoyed designing and developing it.

YOU CAN WIN THIS!  :)
