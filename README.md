Programming Fundamentals Final Project - Pacman
Programming Language Applied: C++

The game includes 3 progressively challenging levels on console, implementing each maze with a different color theme, divided into 4 Modules:
1. Graphics, Level Designs and their Difficulty Progression (Muskan - Team Lead)
2. User Input, Player Movement and Collision Detection (Eman)
3. Ghost Movements, and their Random and Chase Behavior (Anaya)
4. Game States, Game Over, and Scoreboard Screen (Danyah)

All things considered, our main objective is to deliver a thrilling and interactive Pacman experience to the players.
Hope whoever witnesses this project enjoys playing it, just as much as we enjoyed designing and developing it.
YOU CAN WIN THIS!  :)
